# Virtual-Learning-Platform
<h1 align='center'>VIRTUAL LEARNING PLATFORM FOR VISUALLY IMPAIRED STUDENT</h1>
<h2 align='center'>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
<h3 align='left'>1.1	About the Project</h3>
<p align='justify'>The main objective of this project is helping the visually impaired persons. Visual impairments 
refer to the loss of vision. The students in educational institutions experience various challenges and 
problems out of which, visual impairments has a main impact in their academic performance. Due to 
the lack of their study we created a project named “Virtual Learning Platform for Visually Impaired 
Students”. Our project is used for so many visually challenged students those who are willing to learn 
programming language like php, python, java, etc. Here this webpage will act as an intermediate 
between virtually impaired persons and systems. In our project first we have to create an account for 
learning. We have inserted an audio file that gives the instruction about what will be we want in the 
entire web page. We have created three sections in our project. They are lessons, tests, and results. 
The lesson section contains the full of audio files they can use the short cut keys to play the audios. 
The next section is named as test. The student can hear the audio file and give their answers in the text 
box. The final section is named as result in this section it contains the individual subject marks </p>

<h2 align='center'>2. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS</h2>

<h3 align='left'>Module Description</h3>
<h3 align='left'>User Login:</h3>
<p align='justify'>The webpage will act as an admin. For each student, unique username and password will be

</p>

<h3 align='left'>Lesson</h3>
<p align='justify'>It is the first section came under the classroom module. In this section it contains the teacher’s 
audio files. The lesson page contains 3 programming languages.<br>
<p align='center'>•Php<br>
•Java<br>
•Python<br></p>
At first the users have to select their programming languages. Every programming language 
contains individual questions and answers. The student can press the short cut keys to play them audio 
files.</p>

<h3 align='left'>Test</h3>
<p align='justify'>It is the second section came under the class room module. In this section it contains the 
question audio files. The student can use the short cut key to play the audio question file and they can 
enter their answers in the given text box. The exam will be conducted for the given three programming 
languages.<br><center>
<p align='center'>•Php<br>
•Java<br>
•Python<br></p></p>

<h3 align='left'>Result</h3>
<p align='justify'>And the final section will be named as result. The result page also contain three programming 
languages. It can store the student examination score. The students enter their unique id to know about 
their results. It also is an audio file. They play the audio file to hear their result.</p>
